# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-2
Made a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
Preprocessed and normalized the transaction data, handled class imbalance issues,
and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained a classification algorithm logistic regression to
classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-
score, and also considered the techniques like oversampling or undersampling for
improving results.
